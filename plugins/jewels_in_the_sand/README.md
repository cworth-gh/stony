This plugin manages Jewels in the Sand.

### To-Do List

* Add a `jits guess` command that tracks unruled guesses (essentially a to-do list for the Sultan).
* Add a third category for ambiguity and ruling refusals.
* Consider generalizing categories altogether.
* Add an option to display jewels and sand in alphabetical order.
* Track historical categories.
