This plugin manages Jewels in the Sand.

### To-Do List

* Add a third category for ambiguity and ruling refusals.
* Consider generalizing categories altogether.
* Add an option to display jewels and sand in alphabetical order.
* Track historical categories.
* Add a command to start a new game with seed jewels and sand.
* Consider allowing the Sultan to categorize words using `[word]=[type]` syntax.
* Restrict bot to act in only one channel (still allow intentional
  manipulation from a private channel?)
* Add quotation marks around any "words" in the lists with spaces in them
* Put a speed governor on stony (no list repeats within N seconds?)
* Make stony force everything to lowercase (with an option to preserve case?)
* Add a command to unguess a word
* Allow for a category ruling such as "_all 2-letter words_=sand" to work,
  (without requiring '"_all 2-letter words_"=sand' which currently does
   work).
