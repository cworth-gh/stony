This plugin handles scoring and private answer submission and revealing.

### How It Works

#### Scoring

* `SCORE [score]`: Add _score_ to your score.
* `SCORES`: Show all scores.
* `CLEAR`: Clear scores.

#### Inputs and Revealing

* `INPUT [answer]`: Set your answer to _answer_.
* `REVEAL`: Show all submitted answers.

### To-Do

* Add timing/auto-reveal functionality.
* Allow the specification of a game leader, who is the only person who can `REVEAL`.
