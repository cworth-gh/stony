This plugin handles private answer input and reveal functionality.

### How It Works

Users PM stony their answers using `in [answer]`.

Then, in any channel, when someone types `REVEAL`, stony will show everyone's answers.

That's about it!

### To-Do

* Turn this into a general game-facilitation plugin.  For now, this means add scorekeeping.
* Add timing/auto-reveal functionality.
* Allow the specification of a game leader, who is the only person who can `REVEAL`.
